# My GitHub Learning Lab Repository for GitHub Pages

I am learning to build my first blog with the help of [Github lab robot](https://lab.github.com/courses). Now you can visit my rough blog [here](https://jack12xl.github.io/github-pages-with-jekyll/). Feel free to **issue** me if u have any advice!
