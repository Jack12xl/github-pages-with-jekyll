## This is my first blog ever so I might write anything at will. 
I just watched **VENON** by **Marvel**... Honestly, this film did not suit my type so much. 

There's some rumor about wow how cute the VENON is, oh ~~f**k~~ dame it. It's like 
the **Alien** for almost half of the part. Especially when in the deep dark bio lab surrounded
by dead bodies killed by VENON, Eddie keeping smashing the wall to save (actually free) 
a woman infected by VENON... That reminds me a classic scene in a horror movie which I forgot its name...

On the other hand, the storyline doesn't sound like reasonable, at least for me. Why a
bad-tempered(or tsundere), and gonna-eat-ur-head-off creature starts to have a crush with Eddie suddenly without any
foreshadowing(maybe they were both losers on their homeland)? All I see was the QQ chatting interface(with familiar dididi !) and how eager the producer wanna
to **pander** to audience from China. No wonder the dramatic diff of rating between
DOUBAN and ROTTEN tomatoes.

Thanks god **Marvel** wants to spread VENON in a wider range of 
audience so it's just a PG-13 movie, if it fills with blood and gore, I might 
ran off the theatre immediately(:facepalm).

Maybe horror movie just isn't my thing 0.0 BTW, music and BGM is good, like **Marvel** always do ÔºÅ
